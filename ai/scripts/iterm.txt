$ I'd like to stitch all of these images together vertically. They all have the same dimensiosn

Certainly! I can help you stitch these images together vertically. To accomplish this task, we'll use Python with the Pillow library, which is excellent for image processing. First, let's create a Python script to do this. We'll need to install Pillow if it's not already installed.

Let's start by creating a new Python file and writing the code to stitch the images together. We'll call this file `stitch_images.py`.

ℹ Wrote file "stitch_images.py"

+ import os
+ from PIL import Image
+
+ def stitch_images_vertically(directory):
+     # Get all PNG files in the directory
+     image_files = [f for f in os.listdir(directory) if f.endswith('.png') and f != '.DS_Store']
+     image_files.sort()  # Sort the files to ensure consistent order
+
+     # Open all images
+     images = [Image.open(os.path.join(directory, f)) for f in image_files]
+
+     # Get dimensions of the first image
+     width, height = images[0].size
+
+     # Create a new image with height of all images combined
+     total_height = sum(img.size[1] for img in images)
+     stitched_image = Image.new('RGB', (width, total_height))
+
+     # Paste images one below another
+     y_offset = 0
+     for img in images:
+         stitched_image.paste(img, (0, y_offset))
+         y_offset += img.size[1]
+
+     # Save the stitched image
+     stitched_image.save('stitched_output.png')
+     print("Images stitched successfully. Output saved as 'stitched_output.png'")
+
+ if __name__ == "__main__":
+     stitch_images_vertically('.')  # Use current directory

$ Can we invoke it?

Certainly! To invoke the Python script we just created, we need to use the `shell_execute` function to run it. However, before we do that, we should make sure that the required Pillow library is installed. Let's do this in two steps:

1. Install the Pillow library (if it's not already installed)
2. Run the Python script

Here's how we'll do it:

ℹ Proposed shell command:

> pip install Pillow

ℹ No code was executed.

$ Can we use a virtual env?

Absolutely! Using a virtual environment is a great practice. Let's create a virtual environment, activate it, install Pillow, and then run our script. Here's how we'll do it step by step:

1. Create a virtual environment
2. Activate the virtual environment
3. Install Pillow in the virtual environment
4. Run our Python script

Let's execute these steps:

ℹ Executed shell command:

> python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate && pip install Pillow && python stitch_images.py
✔ Command succeeded.
